# Contractor Project (C#)

## Overview
This project demonstrates core object-oriented programming principles in C# by modeling a contractor and subcontractor system. It includes:

- A `Contractor` base class with attributes such as contractor name, number, and start date
- A `Subcontractor` class that inherits from `Contractor`, adding shift and hourly pay rate functionality
- Constructors, getters (accessors), and setters (mutators) for both classes
- A method to calculate the adjusted pay with a 3% differential for night shifts

## What We Learned
- How to design and implement class hierarchies
- How to use constructors and mutators effectively
- How to upload and commit code using GitHub

## Hurdles We Overcame
- Setting up GitHub Desktop
- Connecting Visual Studio to GitHub
- Understanding how to compile and test the code

## Future Improvements
- Add user input and validation
- Display subcontractor data in a table
- Store multiple subcontractors in a list
